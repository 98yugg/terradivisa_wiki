## History

- **Brief History:** <!--HISTORY-->The Idrisid Dynasty was a nation founded at the start of Terradivisa Season 9 by mrcreeperxddddxd, accompanied by a few payers. The nation would expand in the first weeks to the entirety of Morocco and Portugal, mostly due to the efforts of mrcreeperxddddxd.<!--HISTORY-->
- **Colonization Efforts:** <!--COLONIZATION_EFFORTS--> mrcreeperxddddxd would order the founding of a town at the West, to capture the Panama Canal. Thus, a player would be sent to the west and the town of Batynia was founded. However, the colonization efforts would fail due to the dense jungle and the rough terrain. As a result, the player responsible for Batynia would go to the Sahara desert and found the town of [Sahara](461181c4-a06a-4036-9f30-ba782f4ad5f0_town).<!--COLONIZATION_EFFORTS-->

At the Atlantic Ocean, another player would build a floating city above the ground, named [Cloud City](894bf4e6-c0e9-4f7f-a5d2-48e3ac70e68f_town).
- **Regression and Dissolution:** <!--REGRESSION_AND_DISSOLUTION-->The annexation of Spain by the CCP, alongside the general inactiveness of the players would trigger the dissolution of the nation on December 22, 2024. A public announcement by [Leader mrcreeperxddddxd](mrcreeperxddddxd_user) and MR_patato3 would mark the dissolution of the nation.<!--REGRESSION_AND_DISSOLUTION-->
